HARP - HPC Application Runtime Predictor
======
HARP stands for "HPC Application Resource (runtime) Predictor." It is a solution introduced in the context of high-performance computing (HPC) to help optimize resource allocation for scientific tasks. HARP utilizes prediction-based recommendations and aims to improve the efficient use of resources in HPC environments by considering specific resource requirements and batch queueing policies.
