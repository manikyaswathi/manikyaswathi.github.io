I am Manikya Swathi Vallabhajosyula, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, specializing in AI-integrated Cyberinfrastructure. My research focuses on building agentic, resource-aware, and self-adaptive systems that optimize scientific workflows across the edge-to-HPC continuum.

As a Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. Rajiv Ramnath (https://cse.osu.edu/people/ramnath.6), I contribute to the NSF ICICLE AI Institute and EAGER Bridging the Last Mile projects, where I design frameworks such as the HPC Application Resource Predictor (HARP) and Smart Scheduler to improve AI-driven resource provisioning and workflow orchestration. My recent work extends into LLM-based orchestration layers, enabling natural language–driven workflow management for scientists.

I also serve as the ICICLE NextGen Student Group Manager, leading a national network of 280+ students and organizing K–12 AI outreach and workforce readiness programs. I have mentored over 20 undergraduate and master’s students and guided more than 200 learners through summer research and teaching fellowships.

Before joining OSU, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota Duluth (https://www.d.umn.edu/) where I worked with Dr. Ted Pedersen (https://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/) on Natural Language Processing and semantic relation extraction, and my B.Tech. in Computer Science from VNRVJIET (http://www.vnrvjiet.ac.in/) affiliated with JNTU-Hyderabad (https://jntuh.ac.in/). I also bring four years of professional experience as a software engineer at CA Technologies (https://www.broadcom.com/solutions/ca-technologies-infrastructure-software-solutions) and Spherexx.com (https://www.spherexx.com/), developing full-stack web applications and automation frameworks.

I am passionate about bridging AI, HPC, and domain science through scalable, interpretable, and sustainable computing systems.
