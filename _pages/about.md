I am a 3rd-year Computer Science Ph.D. graduate at The Ohio State University with four years of professional experience developing and testing web and server applications. I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant with [Dr. Rajiv Ramnath](https://cse.osu.edu/people/ramnath.6) at The Ohio State University on an NSF-EAGER (Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research) project â€“ Bridging the Last Mile, which focuses on building an artificially intelligent system to assist researchers to carry their experiments productively. I completed my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at The University of Minnesota Duluth ([UMD](https://www.d.umn.edu/)) (2018). I worked with [Dr. Ted Pederson](https://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/) for my master's thesis in Natural Language Processing. I pursued my bachelor's in CSE from VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology ([VNRVJIET](http://www.vnrvjiet.ac.in/)) affiliated Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad ([JNTU-H](https://jntuh.ac.in/)). For more information on my academic projects, see [Academic Projects].

As a full-stack developer, I worked for a year after my master's at  [Spherexx.com](https://www.spherexx.com/) to work majorly on a voice bot application. I worked for three years at [CA Technologies](https://www.broadcom.com/solutions/ca-technologies-infrastructure-software-solutions), now a Broadcom subsidiary. I joined CA as an associate software engineer and got promoted to software engineer. Here, I worked on tasks ranging from quality analysis to development.
